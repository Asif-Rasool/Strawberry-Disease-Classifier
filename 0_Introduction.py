Agricultural production in Louisiana relies heavily on specialty crops such as strawberries, which contribute substantially to both local economies and cultural heritage. However, strawberry yields are frequently threatened by foliar and fruit diseases that, if left undetected, can trigger cascading economic losses‚Äîparticularly for small and mid‚Äêsized operations. Early, accurate detection of these diseases enables targeted interventions, minimizes unnecessary pesticide use, and preserves yields. Building upon existing deep‚Äêlearning approaches in related crops, our project aims to develop an end‚Äêto‚Äêend plant‚Äìdisease classification system that first focuses on strawberries, then extends to potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers. The system will consist of both a web application and a mobile application powered by a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of classifying foliar and fruit diseases. Ultimately, we intend to publish our methodology in a high‚Äêimpact journal, documenting model performance, deployment strategies, and real‚Äêworld validation in Louisiana farming contexts.  

Louisiana strawberry producers face multiple disease pressures‚Äîsuch as angular leaf spot, gray mold, and powdery mildew‚Äîwhich can reduce fruit quality and lead to outright crop losses if not managed promptly. According to USDA estimates, Louisiana ranks among the top five U.S. states in winter strawberry production; even small disease outbreaks can reduce returns by 15‚Äì30 percent for individual growers. Early‚Äêseason disease detection is therefore essential to reducing spray costs and avoiding sizable yield declines. Moreover, many Louisiana farms operate within tight profit margins: over 60 percent of strawberry acreage is produced by small farms (fewer than 50 acres), and direct‚Äêmarket sales (e.g., farmers‚Äô markets, on‚Äêfarm sales) amplify each percentage point of lost yield. Given these stakes, a reliable, accessible disease‚Äêdetection tool‚Äîone that a farmer can deploy via smartphone in the field‚Äîwould directly benefit rural livelihoods and strengthen regional food security.  

From a technical standpoint, existing systems for strawberry disease detection have tended to rely on object‚Äêdetection models (e.g., Faster R‚ÄêCNN), which output bounding boxes around lesions. While effective, such approaches often require high‚Äêresolution images and a consistent imaging protocol (e.g., fixed distance, fixed lighting), limitations that reduce their utility for growers scouting plants in natural, heterogeneous environments. In contrast, instance segmentation models (Mask R‚ÄêCNN and its variants) can generate pixel‚Äêlevel masks for each lesion class, enabling fine‚Äêgrained localization under varied backgrounds. Afzaal et al. (2021) introduced a Mask R‚ÄêCNN approach for seven strawberry diseases, reporting a mean average precision of over 82 percent on a curated dataset of 2,500 images. Their work demonstrates that robust segmentation of strawberry lesions under complex greenhouse and field conditions is achievable given appropriate data-augmentation strategies and careful tuning of backbone networks (ResNet50/101). Drawing inspiration from that study, our project will adapt and extend these methods to Louisiana‚Äôs specific cultivars, environmental conditions, and disease pressures.
